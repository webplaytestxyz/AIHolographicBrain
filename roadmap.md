Roadmap — Evolving the AI Holographic Brain
==========================================

This roadmap outlines a staged plan to evolve the MVP holographic field toy into a more brain-like, emergent system capable of richer reasoning and outputs. It emphasizes gradual, testable changes that keep the simple prompt-and-attractor interface while increasing internal complexity.

Phase 1 — Strengthen the Core Field Dynamics
-------------------------------------------
Goal: Make the field more expressive and “alive” without changing the output interface yet.

- Increase Dimensionality
  - Move from the current (amplitude, phase) pair to 4–8 channels per node: amplitude, phase, context, memory trace, inhibitory/excitatory balance, etc.
  - This allows richer internal representations and interference patterns without requiring a UI change.

- Non-local Coupling
  - Introduce interactions beyond immediate 6-neighbor Laplacian. Use Gaussian or distance-weighted kernels to allow "long-range communication," mimicking cortical connectivity.

- Oscillatory Dynamics
  - Introduce frequency-specific oscillations (e.g., gamma-like pulses) for emergent synchrony.
  - Implement by evolving each channel with sine/cosine components combined with coupling.

- Noise and Perturbation Tuning
  - Controlled stochasticity allows multiple attractors to compete before the system stabilizes — simulating "intuition vs reasoning." Tune annealing schedules.

Phase 2 — Multi-Prompt Interaction & Interference
-------------------------------------------------
Goal: Enable the field to integrate multiple inputs and produce emergent outcomes.

- Superposition of Prompts
  - Allow multiple prompt injections to propagate and interfere naturally in the field. Observe emergent attractors — some may dominate, others cancel.

- Temporal Evolution Visualization
  - Add a time slider or history view to see how attractors evolve over iterations. Useful for diagnosing conflict resolution between prompts.

- Dynamic Attractor Tracking
  - Track multiple strong attractors (not just the global max). This can produce multiple candidate answers before collapse to a final choice.

Phase 3 — Emergent Output Mapping
---------------------------------
Goal: Move from fixed hash-based responses to field-driven semantic outputs.

- Learnable Readout Layer
  - Use a small neural readout (MLP) to map attractor states to output tokens. Start supervised on a toy dataset, then refine with a stability/plausibility signal.

- Context Persistence / Memory
  - Store previous attractors as soft constraints or memory traces to influence future field evolution. This mimics short-term memory across turns.

- Semantic Feedback Loop
  - Allow the output to feed back as a mild perturbation into the field to reinforce coherent multi-step patterns. This can enable emergent multi-step reasoning without explicit token-by-token planning.

Phase 4 — Advanced Brain-like Enhancements
-----------------------------------------
Goal: Move toward truly brain-inspired emergent cognition.

- Phase Synchrony Across Channels
  - Encourage clusters of nodes to synchronize phase (gamma-band coherence), enabling rapid formation of global patterns or "insights."

- Hierarchical Fields
  - Stack microfields into a hierarchy (local → regional → global) so prompts propagate from local representations to global attractor space.

- Dynamic Dimensionality
  - Allow channels or nodes to activate/deactivate dynamically (a form of emergent pruning) to save compute and allow specialized subnetworks.

Roadmap: Evolving the AI Holographic Brain
=========================================

Here’s a structured roadmap for evolving your MVP into a more brain-like, holographic LLM — moving from proof-of-concept to a system capable of emergent reasoning.

Phase 1 — Strengthen the Core Field Dynamics
--------------------------------------------
Goal: Make the field more expressive and “alive” without changing the output interface yet.

- Increase Dimensionality
  - Instead of (amplitude, phase), consider 4–8 channels per node: amplitude, phase, context, memory trace, inhibitory/excitatory balance, etc.
  - This allows richer internal representations and interference patterns.

- Non-local Coupling
  - Introduce interactions beyond immediate 6-neighbor Laplacian.
  - Use Gaussian or distance-weighted kernels to allow “long-range communication,” mimicking cortical connectivity.

- Oscillatory Dynamics
  - Introduce frequency-specific oscillations (like gamma pulses) for emergent synchrony.
  - Implement via sine/cosine dynamics combined with Laplacian coupling.

- Noise and Perturbation Tuning
  - Controlled stochasticity allows multiple attractors to compete before the system stabilizes — simulating “intuition vs reasoning.”

Phase 2 — Multi-Prompt Interaction & Interference
-------------------------------------------------
Goal: Enable the field to integrate multiple inputs and produce emergent outcomes.

- Superposition of Prompts
  - Allow multiple prompt injections to propagate and interfere naturally in the field.
  - Observe emergent attractors; some may dominate, some may cancel.

- Temporal Evolution Visualization
  - Add a time slider or history view to see how attractors evolve over iterations.
  - Helps diagnose how the system resolves conflicts between prompts.

- Dynamic Attractor Tracking
  - Keep track of multiple “strong” attractors instead of a single max amplitude.
  - Could allow multiple candidate answers before collapse to a final choice.

Phase 3 — Emergent Output Mapping
---------------------------------
Goal: Move from fixed hash-based responses to field-driven semantic outputs.

- Learnable Readout Layer
  - Map attractor states to output tokens via a small neural network (MLP) trained to preserve stability.
  - Could be supervised at first (toy dataset) or reinforced by “stability + plausibility” score.

- Context Persistence / Memory
  - Store previous attractors as soft constraints for future field evolution.
  - This mimics short-term memory and allows multi-turn emergent reasoning.

- Semantic Feedback Loop
  - Allow output to feed back as mild perturbation into the field to reinforce coherent patterns.
  - Could enable emergent multi-step reasoning without explicit token-by-token planning.

Phase 4 — Advanced Brain-like Enhancements
-----------------------------------------
Goal: Move toward truly brain-inspired emergent cognition.

- Phase Synchrony Across Channels
  - Encourage clusters of nodes to synchronize in phase (like gamma-band coherence).
  - Could allow “insight moments” where attractor forms rapidly across large regions.

- Hierarchical Fields
  - Stack smaller subfields into a hierarchy (local → regional → global) to simulate cortical layers.
  - Prompts propagate from local microfields to global attractor space.

- Dynamic Dimensionality
  - Allow channels/nodes to activate/deactivate dynamically, creating emergent “neural pruning.”

- GPU Scaling / Optimization
  - Move from CPU to multi-GPU fields to handle hundreds of thousands of nodes in real-time.

Phase 5 — User Interface & Interaction
--------------------------------------
Goal: Keep the interface simple while revealing underlying dynamics for research.

- Interactive Prompt Injection
  - Keep click-based excitation and keyboard prompts.
  - Show attractor stabilization live.

- Insight Visualization
  - Highlight emerging attractors in color and size.
  - Optional: show wavefront propagation as animated surfaces or volumes.

- Output Options
  - Text (simple) or speech (optional TTS).
  - History of attractors to visualize “thought evolution.”

Key Notes
---------
- The roadmap emphasizes emergence over explicit reasoning.
- The system should always allow hidden complexity under a simple output interface.
- Initial MVP already captures Phase 1 and 2 concepts; Phase 3+ is where it truly becomes brain-like.
